Redis Design Drafts
===

Redis Design Drafts are a way to make the community aware about the design of
new features before this feature is actually implemented. This is done in the
hope to get good feedback from the user base, that may result in a change
of the design if a flaw or possible improvement was discovered.

The following is the list of published RDDs so far:

* [RDD1 -- Redis Design Drafts](/topics/rdd-1)
* [RDD2 -- RDB version 7 info fields](/topics/rdd-2)

To get an RDD accepted for publication you need to talk about your idea in
the [Redis Google Group](http://groups.google.com/group/redis-db). Once the
general feature is accepted and/or considered for further exploration you
can write an RDD or ask the current Redis maintainer to write one about the
topic.
