## History of revisions

1.0, 10 April 2013 - Initial draft.

## Overview

Redis Design Drafts are a way to make the community aware of designs planned
in order to modify or evolve Redis. Every new Redis Design Draft is published
in the Redis mailing list and announced on Twitter, in the hope to receive
feedback before implementing a given feature.

The way the community can provide feedback about a RDD is simply writing
a message to the Redis mailing list, or commenting in the associated
GitHub issue if any.

Drafts are published only for features already approved as potentially very
interesting for the project by the current Redis project maintainer.

The official Redis web site includes a list of published RDDs.

## Format

The format of RDDs should reflect the format of this RDD.
